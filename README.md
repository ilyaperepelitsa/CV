## Description

A few collected highlights of my work in python, JS and Carto are collected
here.
Some of the projects are pure code, some come with an html that one can open in
chrome. All relevant points will be presented in the general overview


## Contents
Bulk of my work deals with scraping - I love getting to visualizations and ML
but in so many cases you're just swamped with data collection and Data
Engineering matters (spinning databases, dealing with schemas etc.)
There is loads of scrapy (mostly) code as well as some sqlalchemy in there
### Scraping projects
* Dataslap jobs - a job aggregator that I plan to launch as a service for slow
gathering of Glassdoor jobs and putting together tools for job applications on a
scale (cover letter generator, submission scripts, maybe even resume generator
that, similar to cover letter generator, makes ones based on the match of
relevant skills and job description). More advanced features are coming after I
finish with my React.js adventures.
* FERC_DOC_TRAIL - a contract job that I did for these wonderful people:
[VzPI](https://github.com/VzPI) - a set of tools for monitoring pipeline
construction in the U.S. It's a part of the repository, can be found here:
[FERC DOC part](https://github.com/VzPI/FERC_DOC_TRAIL)
* snew - news (yep, puns) aggregator. Started with a few sources, shouldn't
really be discussing them. Two sources at the moment, work in progress
* Met Book downloader - Metropolitan museum published some books for free. This
is a community tool project for downloading them. Published
[here](https://github.com/ilyaperepelitsa/met_book_downloader), got some support
from people for it.
* Intercept - Intercept had a dump of documents with some semi-confidential
stuff. Please take your own risk on what PDFs are evil and what you download.


### Scraping projects
* Python graphs - I started putting together some boilerplate for graphs.
Initiated a boxplot graph function that accepts arguments to determine how to
order boxes - some usual i.e. by median, mean and some more interesting - by
interquartile range. Also some color pallette code
