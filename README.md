## Description

A few collected highlights of my work in python, JS and Carto are collected
here.
Some of the projects are pure code, some come with an html that one can open in
chrome. All relevant points will be presented in the general overview


## Scraping projects
Bulk of my work deals with scraping - I love getting to visualizations and ML
but in so many cases you're just swamped with data collection and Data
Engineering matters (spinning databases, dealing with schemas etc.)
### Legal
* Dataslap jobs - a job aggregator that I plan to launch as a service for slow
gathering of Glassdoor jobs and putting together tools for job applications on a
scale (cover letter generator, submission scripts, maybe even resume generator
that, similar to cover letter generator, makes ones based on the match of
relevant skills and job description). More advanced features are coming after I
finish with my React.js adventures.
* FERC_DOC_TRAIL - a contract job that I did for these wonderful people:
[VzPI](https://github.com/VzPI) - a set of tools for monitoring pipeline
construction in the U.S. It's a part of the repository, can be found here:
