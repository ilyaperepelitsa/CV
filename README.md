## Description

A few collected highlights of my work in python, JS and Carto are collected
here.
Some of the projects are pure code, some come with an html that one can open in
chrome. All relevant points will be presented in the general overview


## Scraping projects
Bulk of my work deals with scraping - I love getting to visualizations and ML
but in so many cases you're just swamped with data collection and Data
Engineering matters (spinning databases, dealing with schemas etc.)
### Legal
* Dataslap jobs - a job aggregator that I plan to launch as a service for slow
gathering of Glassdoor jobs and putting together tools for job applications on a
scale (cover letter generator, submission scripts, maybe even resume generator
that, similar to cover letter generator, makes ones based on the match of
relevant skills and job description). More advanced features are coming after I
finish with my React.js adventures.
* FERC
* We created a tool that is hopefully very useful for you. The rest is your responsibility.
If you choose to be intrusive and disrespectful - it is your choice and not ours.
* Our default download delay is set to **3 seconds** - this will get you about a GB
of documents in an hour. That's a GB of PDF files, DOC files and images. It isn't
likely that you're going to process all the documents in a day, don't bee greedy
and opt in for longer delays, be realistic and respectful.
