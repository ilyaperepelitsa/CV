# CV
Ilya Perepelitsa


## Description

A few collected highlights of my work in python, JS and Carto are collected
here.
Some of the projects are pure code, some come with an html that one can open in
chrome. All relevant points will be presented in the general overview


## Scraping projects
Bulk of my work deals with scraping - I love getting to visualizations and ML
but in so many cases you're just swamped with data collection and Data
Engineering matters (spinning databas)
